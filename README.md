# Coffee Orders Data Analysis - May 5 2025

## Overview

This project involved analyzing a small dataset of coffee orders for an online store from 2019 till 2022 . . The goal was to understand sales trends by identifying the top-selling coffee type, top customers, and sales by each country.  The analysis was performed using Microsoft Excel.
## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is named `[YourFileName.csv or YourFileName.xlsx]` and contains the following columns:

* **[Column Name 1]:** [Brief description of the column and its data type, e.g., "Date of the transaction (YYYY-MM-DD)"]
* **[Column Name 2]:** [Brief description, e.g., "Name of the product sold (Text)"]
* **[Column Name 3]:** [Brief description, e.g., "Quantity of the product purchased (Integer)"]
* **[Column Name 4]:** [Brief description, e.g., "Price of a single unit of the product (Currency)"]
* **[Column Name 5]:** [Brief description, e.g., "Unique identifier for each customer (Integer)"]
    * *(Add descriptions for all relevant columns in your dataset)*

The dataset was [mention the source of the data or how it was created, e.g., "extracted from the company's internal database" or "created for this exercise"].

## Analysis Steps

The following steps were taken to analyze the data:

1.  **Data Cleaning:**
    * [Describe any data cleaning steps you performed in Excel, e.g., "Checked for and removed any duplicate rows." or "Handled missing values in the 'Customer ID' column by [your method]." or "Standardized text entries in the 'Product' column using the `TRIM` function."]
2.  **Descriptive Statistics:**
    * [Mention the key metrics you calculated and how, e.g., "Calculated the total sales for the month using the `SUM` function on the 'Price' and 'Quantity' columns."]
    * [e.g., "Determined the average order value by dividing the total sales by the number of unique orders."]
    * [e.g., "Identified the most popular product by counting the occurrences of each product using the `COUNTIF` function."]
3.  **Basic Visualization:**
    * [Describe the charts you created and their purpose, e.g., "Created a bar chart to visualize the total sales for each product."]
    * [e.g., "Generated a line chart to show the trend of daily sales over the month."]
    * *(You can even mention the Excel features you used to create these charts)*

## Key Findings

Based on the analysis, some key findings include:

* [State your first key insight, e.g., "The total sales for January 2025 were $[amount]."]
* [State your second key insight, e.g., "The most popular product was '[Product Name]', accounting for [percentage]% of total sales."]
* [State your third key insight, e.g., "There was a noticeable increase in sales during the second week of January."]
    * *(List 2-3 significant observations from your analysis)*
